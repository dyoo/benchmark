Benchmark

Purpose: run programs under particular platforms, measuring runtime
and making sure the output is correct.



A platform is:

   * js-vm
   * original sicp compiler
   * my revised sicp compiler (using the Racket machine structures)
   * raw racket


We also need to take into account the effect of the machine that
we're running on.  Let's call this a host.


A host is a string that describes the machine we're on.
e.g. "Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Quad CPU Q6600 @ 2.40GHz"



An _output_ is the textual content captured from standard output and
standard error.


A measurement has:

   A date when the measurement was taken.
   A host machine
   A platform
   A program
   A time
   An output



A program suite is a directory of programs.  That directory should
include source code, named "program0", "program1", ..., "programN".
If there's some shared code between each program run, it should be
included in a "shared" file.  The expected output should be in a file
called "expected".

    program0
    program1
    program2
    ...
    shared



A platform should be able to _run_ a program.  A program may need to
adapt a program to run under it.



Each of the programs+shared should be written in a simplified Scheme
sublanguage to make it easy for adapting to different platforms.
